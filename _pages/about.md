<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a junior undergraduate student at **Dalian University of Technology**, majoring in **Software Technology**.

Now working as a research intern at **[THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/)** (2023.7 - present), learning around LLM & (multi-) agent, and participated in project **[ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)**.

**Actively seeking for a Master & Ph.D. opportunities  on NLP/LLM in the fall of 2025**!

In 2023, I won the **National Scholarship** (**0.2%** of college students per year) and 5 individual scholarships of various kinds, and in 2022, I won **Huawei Smart Pedestal Scholarship**.

In addition to studying and research, I love to play basketball, sing and other activities.


# Research Interest

- I have the will to continue explore the ability of agents driven by LLMs to handle complex downstream tasks, and explore the next emergence of AIGC capabilities through new paradigms such as compressed languages and designing efficient collaboration frameworks.

# Research Experience
**[THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/)(清华大学自然语言处理实验室)**

Research Intern, 2023.7 - present

- Participating in project **[ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)**: Championed the open-source repository through comprehensive testing, optimized the dialogue-related mechanisms between agents, analyzed the generated logs, and carrying out routine maintenance.

- Engaging in research on experiential Co-Learning of agents, which equips agents to more effectively address unseen tasks by accumulating experience, collaborating with other agents, and making critical decisions. Forming a **[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17025)** and a **patent** pending.

- Now exploring the way to further improve the effect of the memory mechanism.

- Participating in the review of EMNLP-2023.


 **Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students - Generating adversarial text**
