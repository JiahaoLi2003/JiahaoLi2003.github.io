<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at **Dalian University of Technology**, majoring in **Software Technology**. And I will continue pursuing a master’s degree at **Tsinghua University**’s Department of Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace in 2025.

Working as a research intern at **[THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/)** (2023.7 - present), learning around LLM & (multi-) agent, and participated in project **[ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)**.

I won the **National Scholarship** (**0.2%** of college students per year) both in 2023 and 2024.
In addition to studying and research, I love to play basketball, sing and other abundant activities.

# Research Interest

- I have the will to continue explore the ability of agents driven by LLMs to handle complex downstream tasks, and explore the next emergence of AIGC capabilities through new paradigms such as compressed languages and designing efficient collaboration frameworks. At the same time, I also look forward to discovering the application of agents in the field of satellite networks.

- other abundant...

# Research Experience
**[THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/)(清华大学自然语言处理实验室)**

Research Intern, 2023.7 - present

Topic 1: Multi-Agents Collaborative Software development - ChatDevs
- Project Introduction: ChatDev is a virtual software company with multi-agents collaborative operation, through interactive collaboration between agents of different roles, software development according to the task needs of human users, and generate a complete software (including code and documentation).
- Main contributions:
  - Championed the open-source repository through comprehensive testing and fixed bugs.
  - Modify the conversation prompt to optimize the relevant dialogue mechanism between agents.
  - Daily maintenance of the project's open source repository.
- Project Results:Paper currently published in **[arXiv:2307.07924](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07924.pdf)**. **[ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)**, an open-source repository.

Topic 2: Empirical Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents
- Project Introduction: By driving agents to extract shortcut experience in historical tasks, as well as memory storage, and mutual inference through experience sample retrieval in unseen tasks,the completion and compilation success rate of agent's autonomous software development are significantly improved.
- Main contributions:
  - Implement the Self-Instruct script to generate instruction samples in the shortcut experience.
  - Empirical persistence experiment analysis, optimization and testing of memory storage mechanism.
  - Parse the generated log file.
  - Complete the experimental content such as task embedding generation classification, LLM software evaluation, dialogue analysis, etc.
- Project Results: Paper currently published in **[arXiv:2312.17025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17025)**. and form a patent pending.


Now exploring the way to further improve the effect of the memory mechanism.
